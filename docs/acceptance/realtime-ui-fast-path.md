## Candidate and production observations

- Candidate image:
  `sha256:2cf64f5ae46dc502889bfba155ecfac784f688c33572ba07c2511323c7719424`.
- Production image:
  `sha256:1400058bee1b737f3482307456f1b6a35512da46bee4bef9a0cdefed472c2b0d`.
- Production base/rollback image:
  `sha256:4d92f7c7569ebe43257be9b985095477f694c5f302f7822dc1696781e279d466`.
- Production URL `http://192.168.10.28:3018` returned HTTP 200 for
  `/health`, `/`, `/dow-monitor`, and `/screener`.
- A production-origin WebSocket subscription for `TSLA.US` received protocol
  `v1` snapshot sequence `12469`, then an update in the same stream at
  sequence `12488`.
- The running collector reported Redis connected, zero Redis publish failures,
  480 latest symbols, and callback-to-publish p95 of 130.98 ms. The Redis
  latest-state key had the configured 86,400-second TTL.
- The existing SSE endpoint remained active in the production log while the
  WebSocket endpoint was in use.

## Failure and fallback observations

- An isolated candidate was started with an unreachable Redis endpoint.
  HTTP `/health` and `/` continued to return 200.
- Its WebSocket returned the explicit protocol message
  `{"type":"fallback","version":"v1","reason":"realtime_redis_unavailable"}`.
- After returning to the valid production Redis endpoint, snapshot hydration
  and ordered updates succeeded without changing the durable ClickHouse path.
- Unit tests cover the three-second initial fallback, 45-second liveness
  fallback, reconnect/session reset, sequence deduplication, and open-session
  Quote/Depth/Candlestick staleness thresholds.

## Outstanding observation

The deployment occurred outside a regular CN/HK/US session. A continuous
ten-minute regular-session observation is still required before changing this
record to unconditional acceptance. Premarket transport observations are not
treated as a substitute for that lower-layer semantic acceptance.

## 2026-07-27 Hong Kong alias recovery

- Frontend source commit: `6def4d9`.
- Production release commit: `4a18b7883211803ee9bb0907a396987f7aa9c3e9`.
- Production image: `tickflow-stock-panel-app:dow-monitor-4a18b7883211`.
- Production entrypoint: `assets/index-BF5RdvZR.js`.
- The regression test first failed because `01347.HK` and `0981.HK` were sent
  unchanged, while the collector keys were `1347.HK` and `981.HK`. After the
  implementation, the focused client suite passed 9 tests and the integrated
  frontend suite passed 75 tests.
- A production-origin WebSocket subscription received snapshots for
  `1347.HK`, `981.HK`, `2714.HK`, and `3759.HK`, four subsequent updates, and
  one 15-second heartbeat over an 18-second observation. It received no
  fallback message.
- The production health endpoint returned HTTP 200 and the running container
  exposed revision `4a18b7883211803ee9bb0907a396987f7aa9c3e9`.
- Browser asset verification loaded the new entrypoint without console
  warnings or errors. Card-level browser acceptance remains pending because
  the pre-existing browser session was invalidated by the production restart
  and the protected monitor APIs returned HTTP 401.

## 2026-07-27 subscribed-symbol backlog recovery

- Backend source commit: `ea44700`.
- Production release commit: `019094cf806600962035069a54a800c41eebf614`.
- Production image: `tickflow-stock-panel-app:dow-monitor-019094cf8066`.
- The failing regression contained more than one drain interval of
  unsubscribed messages followed by two subscribed-symbol updates. The old
  implementation did not reach the subscribed symbol in one cycle. The fixed
  gateway drains the unrelated backlog, coalesces obsolete states per
  subscribed symbol, and delivers only sequence 8. The backend realtime suite
  passes 12 tests.
- A production-origin 22-second WebSocket observation received four current
  snapshots and 187 subsequent updates across `1347.HK`, `981.HK`, `2714.HK`,
  and `3759.HK`. Sequences advanced from 238439 to 241153 and quote timestamps
  advanced during the observation; no fallback was received.
- In an authenticated browser session, no manual reload was performed between
  two card readings 12 seconds apart. `01347.HK` changed from 141.60 to 141.40,
  `0981.HK` from 69.95 to 69.90, and `2714.HK` from 32.74 to 32.76. All four
  cards remained marked `实时`, and `3759.HK` depth and quote time also
  advanced.
